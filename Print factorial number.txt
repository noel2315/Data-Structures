23.You have been given a positive integer N. You need to find and print the 
Factorial of this number without using recursion. The Factorial of a positive 
integer N refers to the product of all number in the range from 1 to N.
Input: N=2
Output: 2
Input: N=4
Output: 24
Ans:
#include<stdio.h>


int main() {
    int n, f = 1;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) f *= i;
    printf("Factorial of %d is %d\n", n, f);
    return 0;
}
